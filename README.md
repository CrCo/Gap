# Gap
A cool little iOS app incorporating SpriteKit, mesh networking and accelerometer capabilities

[See it in action here](https://stephenvisser.blob.core.windows.net/imgs/Gap Demo.mov)

If you run it, you will need to configure the settings (in the Settings App, scroll to the GapDemo app icon) so at least one device controls connections. The other settings are for the style of the balls or to configure where the device is relatively in the topology.
